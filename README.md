# Dimensional Directory Project Overview


The **Dimensional Directory** project is a modular and extensible
framework designed to manage hierarchical and multidimensional data

with AddressPlanes and control planes, foundational components for
advanced computational frameworks like **C-Space Simulations** and the
**Subconscious System Architecture**.
